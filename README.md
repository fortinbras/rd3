## Fork of react-d3 running on d3js version 7

This is a fork of rd3 - https://github.com/yang-wei/rd3

When rd3 was discontinued, it was working on node version 8, d3 version 3 and react version 16.

It was upgraded here to work on d3js v7.0.4, react 16 and node 12.

LineChart, ScatterChart and Stackedarea are migrated, with minor bugs.

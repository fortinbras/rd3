# ReactJS-D3JS

This is a fork of [**rd3**](https://github.com/yang-wei/rd3)

**ReactJS** + **D3JS** charting framework. Using both togheter, provides a **pixel perfect** experience. 

When **rd3** has been discontinued, it was working on **NodeJS** version 8, **D3JS** version 3 and **ReactJS** version 16.

I upgrade it to work on **D3JS** v7.0.4, **ReactJS** 16 and **NodeJS** 12.

LineChart, ScatterChart and Stackedarea are migrated, with minor bugs.

This projects still mantains some idiosincrasies of the original project, so you have some parts in Class Based Components and Function Based Components in ReacJS.

It has some really nice features, like the **Voronoy Algorithm** to calculate distance between points to display tooltips, and so bo. 

## Demo

There is still a lot of work to include new types of charts. At the moment we have, **Line Chart**, **Scatter Chart**, **Bart Chart**, **Area chart**, **Tree Chart**.

## Future of react-d3 / rd3
This is my fork of rd3 - https://github.com/yang-wei/rd3

I is working with d3js v7.0.4, react 16 and node 10.24.
LineChart and ScatterChart were migrated.

## Options
As soons as I started to migrate to d3js v.7, I realize that there are other react/d3 frameworks available for free on GitHub. So this project will be on hold by now.

## This is my fork of react-d3 running on d3js version 7  

This is my fork of rd3 - https://github.com/yang-wei/rd3

It works with d3js v7.0.4, react 16 and node 10.24.

LineChart and ScatterChart are fully migrated.

## Future of react-d3 / rd3

As soons as I started to migrate to d3js v.7, I realize that there are other react/d3 frameworks available for free on GitHub. So this project will be on hold by now.
